# Prerequisites
- You have Git 2.8 or greater installed on your machine.
- You have a GitHub account. 
- The local network is smooth.



# Create a Hugo site


## Step 1: Install Hugo


```bash
brew install hugo
# or
port install hugo
```

To verify your new install:

```bash
hugo version
```


## Step 2: Create a New Site

```bash
hugo new site yourname
```

The above will create a new Hugo site in a folder named 'yourname'.


## Step 3: Add a Theme

See [themes.gohugo.io](https://themes.gohugo.io/) for a list of themes to consider. This quickstart uses the 'ananke'.


```bash
cd yourname
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
```

Then, add the theme to the site configuration:

```bash
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml
```


## Step 4: Add Some Content

You can manually create content files (for example as `content/post/<FILE>.md`) and provide metadata in them, however you can use the `new` command to do a few things for you (like add title and date):

```
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md
```

Edit the newly created content file if you want, it will start with something like this:

```markdown
---
title: "My First Post"
date: 2021-02-07T10:47:11+01:00
draft: true
---

```

{{% note %}}
Drafts do not get deployed; once you finish a post, update the header of the post to say `draft: false`. More info [here](/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content).

## Step 5: Start the Hugo server

Now, start the Hugo server with [drafts](/getting-started/usage/#draft-future-and-expired-content) enabled:

```
▶ hugo server -D

Running in Fast Render Mode. For full rebuilds on change: hugo server --disableFastRender
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop
```

**Navigate to your new site at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).**

Feel free to edit or add new content and simply refresh in browser to see changes quickly (You might need to force refresh in webbrowser, something like Ctrl-R usually works).

## Step 6: Customize the Theme

Your new site already looks great, but you will want to tweak it a little before you release it to the public.

### Site Configuration

Open up `config.toml` in a text editor:

```
baseURL = "https://example.org/"
languageCode = "en-us"
title = "My New Hugo Site"
theme = "ananke"
```

Replace the `title` above with something more personal. Also, if you already have a domain ready, set the `baseURL`. Note that this value is not needed when running the local development server.

**Tip:** Make the changes to the site configuration or any other file in your site while the Hugo server is running, and you will see the changes in the browser right away, though you may need to [clear your cache](https://kb.iu.edu/d/ahic).

For theme specific configuration options, see the [theme site](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke).

**For further theme customization, see [Customize a Theme](/themes/customizing/).**

### Step 7: Build static pages

```
hugo -D
```

Output will be in `./public/` directory by default (`-d`/`--destination` flag to change it, or set `publishdir` in the config file).


# Host on GitHub

Deploy Hugo as a GitHub Pages project or personal/organizational site and automate the whole process with a simple shell script.
GitHub provides free and fast static hosting over SSL for personal, organization, or project pages directly from a GitHub repository via its GitHub Pages service.

## Step-by-step Instructions

1. Create a `<YOUR-PROJECT>` (e.g. `blog`) repository on GitHub. This repository will contain Hugo's content and other source files.
2. Create a `<USERNAME>.github.io` GitHub repository. This is the repository that will contain the fully rendered version of your Hugo website.
3. `git clone <YOUR-PROJECT-URL> && cd <YOUR-PROJECT>`
4. Paste your existing Hugo project into the new local `<YOUR-PROJECT>` repository. Make sure your website works locally (`hugo server` or `hugo server -t <THEME>`) and open your browser to <http://localhost:1313>.
5. Once you are happy with the results:
    * Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to kill the server
    * Before proceeding run `rm -rf public` to completely remove the `public` directory
6. `git submodule add -b main https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<USERNAME>.github.io.git public`. This creates a git [submodule][]. Now when you run the `hugo` command to build your site to `public`, the created `public` directory will have a different remote origin (i.e. hosted GitHub repository).
7. Make sure the `baseURL` in your config file is updated with: `<USERNAME>.github.io`

### Put it Into a Script

You're almost done. In order to automate next steps create a `deploy.sh` script. You can also make it executable with `chmod +x deploy.sh`.
